Hi, friends, this is Yi Tuan (伊团). I am currently a post-doctor at the Department of Astronomy, Xiamen University, People’s Republic of China. My research interests cover:

(a) The multi-wavelength observations and analyses of binary systems that contain compact objects (white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes).

(b) Data mining and analyses in optical time-series spectroscopic and photometric data from large sky surveys.

(c) Galactic stellar formation and evolution theory; the stellar activities and dynamo.

(d) Procedural generation and artistic rendering of animations for celestial objects.

This is what I am studying:
